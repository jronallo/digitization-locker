== Digitization Locker

Digitization Locker is a demonstration project for streamlining digitization
workflows. The basic idea is that there is a space where TIFs can be dropped
from scanning workstations. This directory is called the locker. When a file
has been stable in the locker for a number of checks, then it is moved into
the holding area. Every so often (possibly overnight) the files in the
holding area are processed.

Processing of files will involve (since nothing is implemented yet):
1. Moving the master into archival storage. In this case a Pairtree will be
   used.
2. A stub metadata record is created.
3. If the files are mead identifiers and the EAD XML is accessible, then
   stub descriptive metadata (a title) is added.
4. Creation of access derivatives. In this case a medium sized JPEG.
